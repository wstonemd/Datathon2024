  abstract = {OBJECT               Chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs) are more common among veterans and elderly persons than among members of the general population; however, precise incidence rates are unknown. The purposes of this study were 1) to determine the current incidence of chronic SDH in a US Veterans Administration (VA) population and 2) to create a mathematical model for determining the current and future incidence of chronic SDH as a function of population age, sex, and comorbidity in the United States VA and civilian populations.                                         METHODS               To determine the actual number of veterans who received a radiographic diagnosis and surgical treatment for SDH during 2000--2012, the authors used the VISN03 VA database. On the basis of this result and data from outside the United States, they then created a mathematical model accounting for age, sex, and alcohol consumption to predict the incidence of SDH in the VA and civilian populations during 2012--2040.                                         RESULTS               Of 875,842 unique (different patient) visits to a VA hospital during the study period, 695 new SDHs were identified on CT images. Of these 695 SDHs, 203 (29\%) required surgical drainage. The incidence rate was 79.4 SDHs per 100,000 persons, and the age-standardized rate was 39.1 {\textpm} 4.74 SDHs per 100,000 persons. The authors' model predicts that incidence rates of chronic SDH in aging United States VA and civilian populations will reach 121.4 and 17.4 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively, by 2030, at which time, approximately 60,000 cases of chronic SDH will occur each year in the United States.                                         CONCLUSIONS               The incidence of chronic SDH is rising; SDH is projected to become the most common cranial neurosurgical condition among adults by the year 2030.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Objective               To examine the population-based incidence, complications, and total, direct hospital costs of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) treatment in a neurosurgical clinic during a 26-year period. The aim was also to estimate the necessity of planned postoperative follow-up computed tomography (CT).                                         Methods                                A retrospective cohort (1990--2015) of adult patients living in Pirkanmaa, Finland, with a CSDH was identified using ICD codes and verified by medical records (                 n                 = 1148, median age = 76 years, men = 65\%). Data collection was performed from medical records. To estimate the total, direct hospital costs, all costs from hospital admission until the last neurosurgical follow-up visit were calculated. All patients were followed until death or the end of 2017. The annual number of inhabitants in the Pirkanmaa Region was obtained from the Statistics Finland (Helsinki, Finland).                                                        Results                                The incidence of CSDH among the population 80 years or older has increased among both operatively (from 36.6 to 91/100,000/year) and non-operatively (from 4.7 to 36.9/100,000/year) treated cases. Eighty-five percent (                 n                 = 978) underwent surgery. Routine 4--6 weeks' postoperative follow-up CT increased the number of re-operations by 18\% (                 n                 = 49). Most of the re-operations (92\%) took place within 2 months from the primary operation. Patients undergoing re-operations suffered more often from seizures (10\%,                 n                 = 28 vs 3.9\%,                 n                 = 27;                 p                 {$<$} 0.001), empyema (4.3\%,                 n                 = 12 vs 1.1\%,                 n                 = 8;                 p                 = 0.002), and pneumonia (4.7\%,                 n                 = 13 vs 1.4\%,                 n                 = 12;                 p                 = 0.008) compared with patients with no recurrence. The treatment cost for recurrent CSDHs was 132\% higher than the treatment cost of non-recurrent CSDHs, most likely because of longer hospital stay for re-admissions and more frequent outpatient follow-up with CT. The oldest group of patients, 80 years or older, was not more expensive than the others, nor did this group have more frequent complications, besides pneumonia.                                                        Conclusions               Based on our population-based study, the number of CSDH patients has increased markedly during the study period (1990--2015). Reducing recurrences is crucial for reducing both complications and costs. Greater age was not associated with greater hospital costs related to CSDH. A 2-month follow-up period after CSDH seems sufficient for most, and CT controls are advocated only for symptomatic patients.},
